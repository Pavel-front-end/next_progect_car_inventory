## Building and deploying in production
If you wanted to run this site in production, you should install modules then build the site with npm run build and run it with npm start:

npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run start
You should run npm run build again any time you make changes to the site.

Note: If you are already running a webserver on port 80 (e.g. Macs usually have the Apache webserver running on port 80) you can still start the example in production mode by passing a different port as an Environment Variable when starting (e.g. PORT=3000 npm start).
